# Minesweeper in one hour

This is (was) a challange to write a minesweeper clone in one hour.
The challnge did not work out due to using a new graphics libary (pyglet).
Which of course means the application depends on pyglet as well.
Instead the aim is now a minesweeper clone.

Hope you know how to play...
